### General Info

This project was mainly built with CSS. I Used the transform rotate and translate properties as well as position properies to create a cool navigation. The navigation menu is positioned absolute to the body, and underneath a container element that is rotated when the toggler button is pressed revealing the navigation menu at the bottom left. This was a unique menu to use in future projects. I can see myself getting creative and building off of this menu's functionailty.
